# Adam Angle's Website

Hello! Welcome to the GitHub repository for my webpage's source code.

This website uses the CodeIgniter 4 framework, more information about that can be found on their [official website](https://codeigniter.com).

## Server Requirements (same as CodeIgniter 4)

PHP version 7.3 or higher is required, with the following extensions installed:

- [intl](http://php.net/manual/en/intl.requirements.php)
- [libcurl](http://php.net/manual/en/curl.requirements.php) if you plan to use the HTTP\CURLRequest library

Additionally, make sure that the following extensions are enabled in your PHP:

- json (enabled by default - don't turn it off)
- [mbstring](http://php.net/manual/en/mbstring.installation.php)
- [mysqlnd](http://php.net/manual/en/mysqlnd.install.php)
- xml (enabled by default - don't turn it off)

## Code Issues

I am sure this code is not foolproof, and I wouldn't doubt that there are hidden bugs here and there. If you notice one (or more) and want to let me know, feel free to add a GitHub issue.
